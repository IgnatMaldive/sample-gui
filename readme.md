# Interactive Calendar GUI

This project is an interactive calendar application with note-taking functionality, developed using HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript. The application features a responsive design with a collapsible sidebar, calendar navigation, and a section to add and display notes. This application (and this text) was created using multimodal large language models (LLMs), including the new 4o model, based on image captures and iterative prompting.
